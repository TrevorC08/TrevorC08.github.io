<p> Ground hogs day is a day that is only celebrated in my hometown. people come from all over the world to see it. This is where the pull a ground hog out of a stump and look for its shadow.  It decides if <q> if there is going to be 6 more weeks of winter or a early spring. </q> This is a tradition that has been going on since 1887. </p>
 
<p> They have a whole groundhog comity called the inner circle they are the one who handle a groundhog. There are 15 members on the inner circle comity. They are in-charge of protecting the legend of the ground hog day alive. </p>  
 
<p> They say the same ground hog has lived for hundreds of years that they have never had a different one. The legend is that they have a magic serum that helps keep him alive. on his off season he lives with his wife in a habitat in the library so people can see him and his wife all year round. </p>
